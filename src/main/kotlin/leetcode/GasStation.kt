    /*
    We cannot perform the road trip if sum(gas) < sum(cost).
    In this situation, the answer will be -1. We can compute the total amount
    of gas in the tank, total_tank = sum(gas) - sum(cost), during the round trip.
    The round trip is only possible if total_tank >= 0, otherwise we return -1.

    We cannot start the trip at a station i if gas[i] - cost[i] < 0, because then
    there is not enough gas in the tank to travel to the i + 1 station. Letâ€™s say
    we have a curr_tank variable that keeps track of the current amount of gas in
    the tank. If at a station curr_tank is less than 0, this means that we cannot
    reach this station. Then, we need to mark this station as a new starting point
    and reset curr_tank to 0 since, at this station, we start with no gas in the tank.
